ModelDiagram
=======

This plugin constructs a diagramatic representation of the Model (Active Record) relationships
(Model in M-V-C architecture) in Ruby on Rails (RoR) application.

Active Record supports three types of relationship between tables:
(1) one-to-one
(2) one-to-many
(3) many-to-many.
You indicate these relationships by adding declarations to your models: has_one, has_many, belongs_to, 
and has_and_belongs_to_many.

There is a tool called 'Gvedit' (graphviz-2.20.2.exe) (http://www.graphviz.org/) which generates
Directed and Undirected graphs. It accepts a dot file in specific format and it generates directed 
graphs free of cost ! :-) We can use the reflections for finding all associations of a Model and feed in
to this Gvedit tool to generate a relationship diagram.

Whenever a new team member enters to any enhancement project, from technical perspective, he tries 
to understand the already developed code. Code comprehension may become difficult if there is no 
proper documentation. There can be many models with different relationships defined amongst themselves.
This plugin will certainly be very helpful for the development and support teams to understand the 
application in technical perspective.


Prerequisites
=======
Install graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org)

Example
=======

rake model_diagram:generate
Generates diagrammatic representation of the model relationship present in your rails app.
The model_relationship.dot and model_relationship.png files will be generated at the application root folder.

Consider the following scenario :-

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  	belongs_to :father, :class_name=>'Person'
 	belongs_to :mother, :class_name=>'Person'
end

In the above case, only one node will be generated for Person with "belongs_to mother" and "belongs_to father" edges connecting it.


Special Thanks
